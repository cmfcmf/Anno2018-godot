# Anno 2018

This is a rewrite of twenty-year-old Anno 1602 using a modern game engine (Godot).
My goal is to bring the complete Anno 1602 experience to modern devices.
It uses grahics and configuration of the original game. Due to copyright law,
I cannot include the Anno 1602 graphics with Anno 2018. You need to have a copy of
Anno 1602 installed on your computer to import them into this game.

## Thanks

This would have never been possible without the work of countless Anno enthusiasts:
- [Sir Henry](https://github.com/wzurborg) for their work on different tools around
  the Anno1602 file formats.
- [Benedikt Freisen](https://github.com/roybaer) for their work on _mdcii-engine_
  and decoding further Anno1602 file formts.
- The countless forum posts and websites who worked on Anno1602 mods.
