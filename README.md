# Anno 2018

This is a rewrite of twenty-year-old Anno 1602 using a modern game engine (Godot).
My goal is to bring the complete Anno 1602 experience to modern devices.
It uses grahics and configuration of the original game. Due to copyright law,
I cannot include the Anno 1602 graphics with Anno 2018. You need to have a copy of
Anno 1602 installed on your computer to import them into this game.
